# Cifar-10
This project is a demonstration of image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model to classify images into one of these 10 classes.

  ## Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset includes images from 10 different categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## The steps involved in this notebook include:

- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Model Building**
- **Model Training and Validation**
- **Evaluation**
## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

- **Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck**
- **Input size: 32x32 pixels**
- **Color: RGB**
## Model
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used for this project consists of the following layers:

- **Input Layer: 32x32x3 (RGB image)**
- **Convolutional Layers: Several layers with filters, ReLU activation, and max pooling**
- **Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers for final classification**
- **Output Layer: Softmax activation with 10 output units (one for each class)**
## Installation
**To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:**

  ```bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage
You can run the project by executing the notebook cifar-10-main.ipynb. Below is an example of how to use the trained model to make predictions:

python
Copy code
# Load and preprocess dataset
# (Include preprocessing code from your notebook here)

# Build and compile model
# (Include model creation and compilation code here)

# Train the model
# (Include code for training the model)

# Evaluate on test set
# (Include evaluation code)

# Predict using the model
predictions = model.predict(test_images)
## Results
Accuracy: Achieved [insert accuracy] on the test set after training for [insert number] epochs.
Loss: [Insert loss] after training.
Include sample visualizations such as loss and accuracy curves, and some sample classified images, if available.
